<h3>9. No, but really. What's this all about?</h3>

<p>
	In 1948, Hungarian physicist and Manhattan Project scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Szilard">Leo Szilard</a> published a short story titled “The Mark Gable Foundation”. Reminiscent of HG Wells’s <em>The Time Machine</em>, the unnamed narrator, who wanted to see what the world would be like in 300 years, arranges to be frozen, or "withdrawn from life" as the process is called, until the year 2260. However, he is awakened after only 90 years, and learns the facts of a strange new way of life on earth. Teeth had become unfashionable, and the richest man on earth, Mark Gable, had made his fortune by selling his sperm and producing millions of “donated children,” each of which earned him thousands of dollars in royalties.
